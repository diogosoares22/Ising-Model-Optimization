# Ising Model Optimization

This project aims to apply variants of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to one of the simplest models of the community detection problem and to compare the performance and properties of these methods. 

## Code organization

The code is organized in several modules:
1. Algorithms (Metropolis Hastings, Houdayer, Mixed algorithms, Grid Search) -> `algorithms.py`
2. Loss functions to Minimize -> `functions.py`
3. Graph generator -> `generate_graph.py`
4. Plotter -> `plotting_overlaps.py`


## Contest Data

The contest data can be dowloaded here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14DAawBR24Jr48ZaMHSiBnrLLTkLT2G7J?usp=sharing, afterwards the files need to be placed at code/contest_data.
